# FILAD - LifeVoice
> LifeVoice is an online communication tool in a 2D space. This project aims to make virtual interactions more human thanks to an interface that takes advantage of the real world. The project has a map representing a school. Players can move around the different rooms to interact with other participants. The voice link is limited to the location of the player, the goal being to reproduce human interactions.
